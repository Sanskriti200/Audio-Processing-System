🔊 Smart Audio Processing on Raspberry Pi 4B with Python
This repository contains the implementation of a real-time audio processing system developed on a Raspberry Pi 4B using Python. The project includes features like live audio capture, filtering, volume control, echo/reverb effects, and an optional autotune module. Designed to demonstrate the use of the Pi as a low-cost DSP platform, the system uses USB or I²S microphones and processes audio either in blocks or streams for real-time playback.

🔊 Features:
Real-time audio recording and playback

Live digital effects: echo, reverb, volume control, and autotune

Smooth audio stream handling using Python sound libraries

Block-wise audio processing for improved performance

Designed for plug-and-play use with USB mic and standard earphones

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python (NumPy, SciPy, sounddevice/pyaudio)

Raspberry Pi 4B with Raspbian OS

USB Microphone (for audio input)

3.5mm Audio Jack (for output)
